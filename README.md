# üí´ About Me:
 I'm currently working on developing my own portfolio website. It's an exciting project where I'm showcasing my skills, projects, and achievements. I'm putting my web development expertise to use and designing an intuitive and visually appealing portfolio that reflects my personal brand.[![Portfolio](https://img.shields.io/badge/Portfolio-%230077B5.svg?logo=Portfolio&logoColor=white)](https://yujenm.github.io/Portfolio/) <br> I'm always looking to collaborate with fellow developers on interesting projects. If you have a project idea or need assistance with a project, feel free to reach out! I enjoy working in teams and believe that collaboration fuels innovation.<br>I'm also open to receiving help and mentorship. If you have experience in areas such as UI/UX design, responsive web development, or portfolio optimization, I would greatly appreciate any guidance or suggestions you can provide.<br>I'm currently learning new technologies and expanding my skill set. Some areas of focus for me right now include [specific technologies or programming languages you're currently learning or interested in]. I believe in continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends.<br> Ask me about any of my projects, web development, or programming in general. I'm always happy to share my knowledge and experiences with others.<br> The term "bug" in computer programming originated from an incident in 1947 when a moth got trapped in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer, causing a malfunction. Since then, the term "debugging" has been used to refer to the process of fixing errors and issues in code.
